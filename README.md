Parking lot management built in JAVA
The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans.
The parking lot has motorcycle spots, car spots and large spots.
A motorcycle can park in any spot
A car can park in a single compact spot or a regular spot
A van can park but it will take up 3 regular spots

The application tells how many spots are available and how many spots are remaining.
It also can tell when the parking lot is full or empty.
